# Google-Image-Scrapping-Project

• The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on
experience in web scraping using Python.

• I chose to focus on extracting images from Google Images as
a practical application of data collection techniques.

• The project successfully retrieved a collection of images
related to 'MS Dhoni' from Google Images.

• In conclusion, this image scraping project showcases the
effective use of web scraping tools, combining BeautifulSoup
and urllib, to retrieve and organize images from Google.
